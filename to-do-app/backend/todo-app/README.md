# from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
    ## FastAPI
        This is the main framework used to build the API.
    ## Depends, HTTPException
        These are used for dependency injection and handling errors in the API.
        Dependency injection (DI) is a programming technique for providing an object with the dependencies it needs to function, rather than having the object create them itself.
